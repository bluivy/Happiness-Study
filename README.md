# Happiness-Study (EXPLATORY DATA ANALYSIS)

he World Happiness Index is a survey of the global state of happiness. The first report was published in the year 2012 and subsequently till 2019. This survey ranks 155 out of 195 countries.

Instead of the actual values, the data here indicates how much a feature contributes to the happiness score.

The features that are used in the dataset are :

Country
Score
GDP per capita
Social support
Healthy life expectancy
Freedom to make life choices
Generosity
Perceptions of corruption
Rank
However the survey does not contain details about countries like North Korea and Turkmenistan. North Korea and Turkmenistan have strict dictatorship and censorship and have state sponsored propaganda.

Getting data about countries like these might be an interesting one but on the other hand extremely difficult to collect it.

The main aim of this dataset is to see whether a country's form of government have any effect on the country's happiness index.
